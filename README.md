Jarvis is an A.I. personal assistant here made for MacOS which works on the command line. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and perform many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.
